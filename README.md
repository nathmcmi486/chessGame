# chessGame

A Chess game that includes a player vs player mode and a player vs computer mode

- The "[randomComputer](https://github.com/nathmcmi486/chessGame/tree/randomComputer)" branch is for a computer player that makes moves at random (not very good at playing) - best version to use
- The "master" branch does have a computer player but it is still being worked on and does not work
